# Installing Windows
Windows ISO files can be downloaded from the following links

## Windows 10
- [Official Download - Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)

  You will need to be running Windows to run the Media Creation Tool.
  To bypass this and download the .iso file **without using the Media Creation Tool**, follow these steps:
  1. **Open a Chromium-Based Browser**:
      - Both Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge work.
      - **FireFox** users can download the [Side View Addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/side-view/) and access the site through there.
  
  2. **Change the Browser’s User Agent**:
      - Open the Developer Tools by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`.
      - Click on the "Network" tab.
      - Under the “User Agent” section, click the dropdown and select a mobile device (e.g., BlackBerry BB10).
  
  3. **Visit the Microsoft Website**:
     - Go to the official Windows 10 download page:  
       [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)
  
  4. **Refresh the Page**:
     - After changing the user agent, refresh the page to load it as if you're accessing it from a mobile device.
  
  5. **Select the Windows 10 Version**:
     - Choose the edition and language of Windows 10 you want to download.
  
  6. **Download and Save the ISO File**:
     - Choose either the 32-bit or 64-bit version, and click "Download".
