## Installing Windows
Windows iso files can be downloaded from the following links
1. Windows 10
    - [Official Download - Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)
  
      You will need to be running Windows 10 or newer to run the installer.
      To bypass this and download the .iso file **without using the Media Creation Tool**, follow these steps:
      
      1. **Open a Chromium-Based Browser**:
         - Use a browser like Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.
      
      2. **Change the Browser’s User Agent**:
         - Open the Developer Tools by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`.
         - Click on the "Network" tab.
         - Under the “User Agent” section, click the dropdown and select a mobile device (e.g., BlackBerry BB10).
      
      3. **Visit the Microsoft Website**:
         - Go to the official Windows 10 download page:  
           [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)
      
      4. **Refresh the Page**:
         - After changing the user agent, refresh the page to load it as if you're accessing it from a mobile device.
      
      5. **Select the Windows 10 Version**:
         - Choose the edition and language of Windows 10 you want to download.
      
      6. **Download the ISO File**:
         - Choose either the 32-bit or 64-bit version, and click "Download".
      
      7. **Save the ISO File**:
         - Save the ISO to your desired location for later use (e.g., for creating a bootable USB or installing directly).
